<h1>Heyyy, bruvvv</h1> 

<p>So... something happened, huh? And now your brain won’t stop rewinding it, analyzing it, blaming yourself for every second of it.</p>

<p>I wish I could be there right now to tell you that it’s okay!! You’re a person just like everybody else and it’s like literally in our nature to make mistakes. You’re not a mind reader. You’re not a perfectly programmed NPC. You’re a person, and part of being a person means you’re gonna mess up sometimes. It’s literally part of the user agreement we all didn’t sign up for.</p>

<p>We mess up sometimes. We say things we didn’t mean. We forget. We stumble. We get overwhelmed. We react instead of responding. And yeah, sometimes we hurt people, or ourselves, in the process.</p>

<p>I know some people love to forget every good thing you’ve done the moment you make a mistake. And honestly fuck those people. They act like they’re all high and mighty and lmfao. Don’t listen to them, they’re all just a bunch of extras in your life. The casting team should honestly be more selective next season.</p>

<p>But remember that a mistake doesn’t erase who you are. It doesn’t make you less kind. Less good. Less worthy of love. If you messed up? Okay. So what? Who hasn’t?</p>

<p>What matters more is what you choose to do next—whether that’s making it right, learning from it, or simply giving yourself the grace to heal. You’re someone who is trying, and that effort matters more than perfection ever could.</p> <br>

<b><p>Here’s the deal:<br></p></b>
<p>—If you do feel sorry, it’s okay to say so.<br></p>
<p>—If you don’t fully know what you feel yet, that’s also okay.<br></p>
<p>—If you’re not ready to talk or fix it or revisit it, you’re still allowed to rest first.<br></p>
<p>—If you already made things right, you’re allowed to move on. You don’t have to keep punishing yourself to prove you care.</p><br>

<p>What matters most isn’t avoiding every single mistake (no one can do that, seriously) it’s what you do after.</p>

<p>Learn from it if there’s something to learn. Laugh about it if it’s that kind of stupid mistake (I’m down to roast it lovingly if you want). But mostly: be kind to yourself.</p>

<p>You can apologize if you need to.<br></p>
<p>You can forgive yourself when you’re ready.<br></p>
<p>And most importantly, you can try again.</p>

<p>You’re allowed to mess up and still be worthy of good things. You’re allowed to grow from it without hating yourself first.</p>

<p>And if you’re not feeling guilty? Honestly? I get it. That already happened to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes people just got what was coming to them. (I don’t know why saying that made me sound like a cartoon villain. But you know I’m serious.) Eventually, you’ll come to terms with how you feel about the situation and I know you’ll handle it the right way.</p>

<p>Also, if all else fails: I’ll come get you, we fake our deaths, change names, and move to a beach town where nobody knows us. Plan B.</p>

<p>Just saying!</p>

<p>HAHA ily!</p>
