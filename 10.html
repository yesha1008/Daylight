<h1>Deserved</h1> 

<p>...No, I‚Äôm kidding, of course.</p>

<p>I know being sick sucks. Whether it‚Äôs just a sniffle or something heavier, your body‚Äôs working overtime right now. So please, take it easy. Don‚Äôt push yourself. Don‚Äôt feel guilty for slowing down. You‚Äôre allowed to rest, even if the world feels like it‚Äôs still spinning around you.</p>

<p>So! Here are my mom (and kylie‚Äôs) way of taking care of me when I‚Äôm sick HAHA. And as a future doctor, I should know how a person can heal properly.</p>

<p><b>1. Firstly, drink medicine bro.</b></p>

<p>‚ÄîAre you expecting to get well without any paracetamol?? (technically you can but hey this speeds things up) (eat something before doing so. unless prescribed otherwise)</p>

<p><b>2. EAT SOMETHING!!!</b></p>

<p>Your body is at war right now. You think it can win with no fuel?? I know, I know it might feel like you‚Äôre gonna puke sometimes. But you can‚Äôt really avoid puking. That‚Äôs gonna happen either way, better to have something in your stomach. It‚Äôs better to puke food than blood (stop imagining it, gross!). And like in any fanfic, soup would be best.</p>

<p><b>3. EAT FRUITS AND VEGGIES.</b></p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know if you like eating them or if you‚Äôre like everybody else, but go eat please. And this is not a one time thing! Regularly bro. Not just when you‚Äôre sick.</p>

<p><b>4. Cool, damp cloth (or those little stickers i have no idea what theyre called)</b></p>

<p>This helps I swear! Press it to your forehead, neck, wrists, or wherever feels warm. You‚Äôll feel fresh afterwards, for real.</p>

<p><b>5. Rest.</b></p>

<p>FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING: REST! May I remind you that you‚Äôre not a robot... I don‚Äôt care if you have a deadline coming up.</p>

<p><b>6. More important than half your current to-do list.</b></p>

<p>Stay hydrated or suffer the dizziness consequences.</p>

<p><b>7. Put that damn phone down.</b></p>

<p>I know you‚Äôre reading this on your phone, but after this?? CHUCK IT ACROSS THE ROOM. Okay maybe not literally, but at least stop using it. Watch a TV show from a safe 5-foot distance. Your head will thank you.</p>

<p><b>8. Go to the hospital</b></p>

<p>Bro, if you know you can‚Äôt handle it anymore, why are you waiting?? Like?? What are we doing?? I don‚Äôt even know why you‚Äôd hesitate, I‚Äôd personally jump at the opportunity. I LOVE hospitals, bro. Have you smelled that place?? The scent of alcohol mixed with mysterious sterile chemicals??? The soft, cold beds??? The consistent hum of the aircon??? I‚Äôd live there if they let me.</p>

<p>Take care, bruv! I‚Äôm sending virtual hugs and every cozy thing I can through this screen.</p>

<p>Get well soon, I miss the bright you already!</p>
