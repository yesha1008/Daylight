<h1>Heyyy, bruv!</h1> 

<p>You don’t have to pretend right now.</p>
<p>If you’re here, reading this, then something must’ve brought you so low that even breathing feels like a chore.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re doubting something you used to love. Something you believed in so hard. Maybe you’re starting to think if it was all worth it.</p>

<p>But listen, don’t give up. Not yet.</p>

<p>I know it’s tempting. To shut it all out. To disappear. To stop trying. To just let it go. Not because it stopped mattering, but because it started hurting more than you expected.</p>
<p>I get that. I’ve been there. And I know this kind of heartbreak cuts deep, because it’s not just the thing itself, it’s the hope you had in it.</p>

<p>You’ve come so far. You’ve made it through nights you thought would destroy you. And even if this one feels worse, I promise you, it will pass. Maybe not quickly. Maybe not easily. But it will. The pain won't stay forever. You won’t feel like this forever.</p>

<p>You’ve poured your time, your heart, your energy into this. You’ve gotten through hard days before, days that made you want to walk away. And somehow, you stayed. That strength is still there. Even if it feels a little quieter right now.</p>

<p>And even if you can’t hold yourself up right now, let me.</p>
<p>You are not a burden.</p>
<p>You are not weak.</p>
<p>You are a living, breathing miracle for surviving this long, and that counts more than anything else right now.</p>

<p>You don’t even have to know the next step. One small choice at a time. Even if the outcome isn’t what you imagined, your effort still matters.</p>

<p>Don’t let doubt erase something you once loved.</p>

<p>I’m not giving up on you. Not today. Not ever. And neither should you.</p>

<p>But if you need me to carry the belief for now, I will.</p>

<p>Even if this doesn’t go how you planned.</p>
<p>Even if you come back to it later, or start something new.</p>

<p>You’re meant for great things.</p>

<h3>—A.</h3>
